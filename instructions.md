### Your Team Repo is: t7-bubbles


## Each team member must create a github account.

## I tried to get your files from Brian's public_html, if they are wrong let me know.

# Once github account is created go to: http://goo.gl/forms/W9QJ4tVYA5

### Once invited you will clone repo by:


# Step 1: open terminal
# Step 2: login to cs ssh by: ssh username@login.cs.duke.edu
# Step 3: cd public_html
## STEP 4: git clone https://github.com/cs-190/t7-bubbles.git


### How to use github:
(Theres an awesome app called github desktop if you want to use a GUI)

## Otherwise:

### Commands:

# git add (insert name of file you want to push to server here) (no actual parenthesis)
# git commit -m "Insert your message here" (please put message)
# git push origin (name of your branch) EX: david_branch (pushes the file to server)
# git pull (pulls latest version of all files to your computer)
